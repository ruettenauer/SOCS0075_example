## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Citing

You can easily add citations from a bibfile, such as @Abadie.2003, by using the @ and the bibfile key. Putting them into brackets gives you a citation inside the text [@Abadie.2003; @Abadie.2010]. The references below will be generated automatically.

## Using numbers in the text


```{r reg, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Working Directory
setwd("C:/work/Lehre/Dissertation_module/SOCS0075_2023/Example_project/02_Data")

# Load data 
load("WDI_short.RData")

### Estimate linear regression with quadratic term for year 1

# Model 1
mod1.lm <- lm(log(co2_pc) ~ log(gdp_pc) + I(log(gdp_pc)^2),
              data = wd.df[wd.df$year == 2019,])
summary(mod1.lm)
```

The regression above has an intercept of `r round(mod1.lm$coefficients["(Intercept)"], 3)`, and the coefficient for the linear term of GDP is `r round(mod1.lm$coefficients["log(gdp_pc)"], 3)`.
